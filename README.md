# ToDo_List

After stubbornly forcing my way through the problem, I have the following features:
- TODO list Object
  - Description, Category, toDoList Array, checklist, add/remove/edit list Array, setters/getters
- Array of TODO objects, stored locally as a JSON
- Display List of Categories
- Display Sublists when you click on a Category
- Display TODO list when you click on a sublist
  - Mark a list step complete
  - Edit a displayed TODO LIST
      -Add or Remove list items
      -Change the text within existing list items
  - Delete a displayed TODO LIST


The features I still want to implement include:
- Add NEW list Objects
  - User Interface: SAME layout as the edit mode of existing lists
  - Similar logic to edit mode of existing lists


The problem I have run into:
- Spaghetti Code.
  - Most things are a sloppy solution, dependent on obscure variables or functions.
  - Much is not reusable
  - Not ES6

I have already conceptually solved the main problems. I just need to rebuild it to be organized.
So, I will go to smaller projects, and learn properly how to organize my code! Goodbye for now.
